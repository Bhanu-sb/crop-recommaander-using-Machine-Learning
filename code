# Step 1: Data Collection
data = pd.read_csv('crop_data.csv')  # Replace 'crop_data.csv' with your dataset filename

# Step 2: Data Preprocessing
# Perform any necessary data cleaning and preprocessing steps here

# Step 3: Feature Selection
# Select the relevant features and assign them to the 'features' variable
features = data[['feature1', 'feature2', 'feature3']]  # Replace 'feature1', 'feature2', 'feature3' with your selected features

# Step 4: Model Training
# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(features, data['target'], test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Initialize the decision tree classifier
clf = DecisionTreeClassifier()

# Train the model
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Step 5: Model Evaluation
# Make predictions on the test set
y_pred = clf.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the accuracy of the model
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print("Accuracy:", accuracy)
